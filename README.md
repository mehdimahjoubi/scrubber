# scrubber

Simple web app that takes user string input, scrubs it to only alphanumerical characters, logs the scrubbed input, and returns the original inbound input.

The app includes a Spring Boot API and a simple React frontend (Node dependencies to build and run the frontend are included through Maven, so no extra steps need to be taken).
## Run project
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`
## Run tests
`./mvnw test`
